      <h1>Placeholder (DJ Hero Prototype Game)</h1>
      <p>This is a small <a href="https://love2d.org">LÖVE</a> game inspired by the DJ Hero games, built by <a href="https://github.com/portify">port</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Evar678">Evar678</a> <span class="heart">❤</span>. It's fully playable at the moment, but could do with more complete tracks, Settings &amp; Help menus that aren't entirely empty, a proper name, and <em>more effects</em>. Right now the game looks really plain. <strong>If you have any experience with visual effects in LÖVE or at all, hit us up!</strong></p>
